# tap-github

This is a [Singer](https://singer.io) tap that produces JSON-formatted
data from the GitHub API following the [Singer
spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/SPEC.md).

This tap:
- Pulls raw data from the [GitHub REST API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
- Extracts the following resources from GitHub for a single repository:
  - [Assignees](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/assignees/#list-assignees)
  - [Collaborators](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/collaborators/#list-collaborators)
  - [Commits](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/#list-commits-on-a-repository)
  - [Issues](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#list-issues-for-a-repository)
  - [Pull Requests](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#list-pull-requests)
  - [Reviews](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/reviews/#list-reviews-on-a-pull-request)
  - [Review Comments](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/comments/)
  - [Stargazers](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/starring/#list-stargazers)
- Outputs the schema for each resource
- Incrementally pulls data based on the input state

## Quick start

1. Install

   We recommend using a virtualenv:

    ```bash
    > virtualenv -p python3 venv
    > source venv/bin/activate
    > pip install tap-github
    ```

2. Create a GitHub access token

    Login to your GitHub account, go to the
    [Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) settings
    page, and generate a new token with at least the `repo` scope. Save this
    access token, you'll need it for the next step.

3. Create the config file

    Create a JSON file containing the access token you just created
    and the path to the repository. The repo path is relative to
    `https://github.com/`. For example the path for this repository is
    `singer-io/tap-github`.

    ```json
    {"access_token": "your-access-token",
     "repository": "singer-io/tap-github"}
    ```
4. Run the tap in discovery mode to get properties.json file

    ```bash
    tap-github --config config.json --discover > properties.json
    ```
5. In the properties.json file, select the streams to sync

    Each stream in the properties.json file has a "schema" entry.  To select a stream to sync, add `"selected": true` to that stream's "schema" entry.  For example, to sync the pull_requests stream:
    ```
    ...
    "tap_stream_id": "pull_requests",
    "schema": {
      "selected": true,
      "properties": {
        "updated_at": {
          "format": "date-time",
          "type": [
            "null",
            "string"
          ]
        }
    ...
    ```

6. Run the application

    `tap-github` can be run with:

    ```bash
    tap-github --config config.json --properties properties.json
    ```
